## About this project

I worked with CCQ on a project to create a reusable design system that was framework agnostic and therefore reusable and adaptable for a multitude of their various clients. 

As many of their older projects were build with Angular.js and newer were build with React, I suggested we develop a library of components that could be tested with NPM scripts and used SCSS for modularity and to create themes using variables. 

The pattern library was designed using Adobe Xd which meant we could more easily collaborate when working remotely and we could leverage use of the reusable components when wireframing furure apps.
