## About this project

The founder of ZeroTechZone got in touch with me to develop a brand identity for their start-up that aims to engage with entrepreneurs who are new to technology and development to enable them to get better outcomes for their ideas and products.

Together we created a look that captured the founders vision and can be used as a jumping-off point to develop the brand further at a later stage.
